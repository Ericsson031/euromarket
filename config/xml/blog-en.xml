<h4><span style="color: #008080">5. Mingle with Customers on Forums</span></h4>
<p>Aside from waiting for customers to find you, you can find them. Visit forums your target customer participates in and contribute with good content. Remember, potential customers will only read content that is valuable to them. Engage in the conversation or provide solutions to problems using your products.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #008080">6. Create a Facebook Page</span></h4>
<p>Further increase customer interaction by creating a Facebook account for your online store. Use this platform to connect with potential customers.

<h4><span style="color: #008080">10. Share images on Instagram</span></h4>
<p>Bring products to life by sharing the different way to use your product. Use images to tell a story your customers can relate to. Share the creation of your product. Get started by checking out these businesses who brought their products to life with <a href="http://business.instagram.com/blog/tagged/brand_spotlight" target="_blank">Instagram</a>.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #008080">11. Start a Blog</span></h4>
<p>Write about a topic relevant to your target customer. Tell stories about your product that makes customers fall in love or teach them something new. By drawing customers in, you increase the chance of selling the products on your online store. Be sure to include keywords in your blogpost to help your SEO!</p>
<h4><span style="color: #008080">12. Promote sales with Social Media</span></h4>
<p>Now that you have your social media outlets setup, use them to endorse your sales. Get everyone to visit your new store by offering discounts for featured products. Your followers already like your social media content; the discount might convince them to make their first purchase.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #008080">13. List Sales on Coupon Sites</span></h4>
<p>People love deals – some specifically shop on stores with sales. Promote your sales with websites that list coupons. <a href="http://biglonglists.com/105-coupon-submissions-sites" target="_blank">Submit coupons</a> to websites like <a href="http://www.retailmenot.com/coupons/submit#sthash.5O1mXcqr.dpuf" target="_blank">RetailMeNot</a>, <a href="http://www.mycoupons.com/submit-a-coupon" target="_blank">MyCoupons</a>, and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/coupons/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>. By promoting your deals, you increase visibility, customer volume, and eventually sales.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #008080">14. Encourage Referrals</span></h4>
<p>Even if you have the perfect product, some customers are just not ready to purchase. Don’t fret, instead encourage them to refer your products by creating and promoting a refer-a-friend program. Referrals seem more trustworthy allowing you to gain better access to potential customers. Learn more about <a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/the-best-ways-to-build-customer-loyalty-for-your-online-store/" target="_blank">building customer loyalty for your online store</a>.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #008080">15. Collect Emails</span></h4>
<p>Customers’ e-mails are important for marketing purposes. Obtain them by running promotions and contests. Work with websites like <a href="http://www.shefinds.com/samplesaturday/?utm_source=homepagebanner" target="_blank">SheFinds </a>that run weekly contests for readers. In exchange for an entry, they must opt in for your e-mails. You can also collect e-mails by offering a coupon code with each newsletter subscription.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #008080">16. Send Newsletters</span></h4>
<p>After you’ve collected e-mails from potential customers, stay in touch by sending newsletters. It’s a great way to convert customers. Each newsletter should either 1) <strong>remind </strong>customers about your store or 2) share a <strong>new </strong>product. Create your email marketing plan with <a href="http://static.mailchimp.com/web/guides/how-to-create-an-email-marketing-plan/package/how-to-create-an-email-marketing-plan.pdf" target="_blank">MailChimp’s guide</a>.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #008080">17. Sell in Person</span></h4>
<p>Just as physical stores use online tools to drive traffic, drive traffic to your online store with traditional advertising. Print nice fliers and business cards. Distribute them locally to interact with potential customers in person. When customers can put a face to your online store you bring in a human aspect.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #008080">18. Attend Networking Events</span></h4>
<p>Attend local events to meet and network with people to promote your business. Interact with other key players in your industry such as suppliers, distributors, and competitors. You will learn more about your industry, gain valuable networks, and meet more potential customers.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #008080">19. Leverage LinkedIn</span></h4>
<p>Keep in touch with people you meet at networking events by adding them as LinkedIn connections. Send messages periodically to build and maintain your relationship with key industry players. You can also broaden your network by asking current connections to introduce you to their connections.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #008080">20. Create an Industry Network</span></h4>
<p>Make friends with other people in your industry! Find other companies in your industry who you are not in direct competition with. In other words, look for companies with the same customers who you can address a different need for. For example, as a dog accessories retailer, work with dog sitters or dog groomers. Cross sell to each other’s client lists to double or triple your client base.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #008080">21. Get listed by Distributors</span></h4>
<p>Brand name distributors often compile lists of authorized online retailers. Request to be added to that list. Use this chance to nurture a great working relationships with your suppliers. They will be more inclined to refer clients directly to you and maybe even let you in on upcoming deals.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #008080">22. List Competitive Prices</span></h4>
<p>List your products on sites such as Google Shopping so thousands of customers can compare your prices. Competitive pricing will drive customers to your site. Increasing the number of visitors increases the chance of closing your first sale! Be sure to <a href="http://www.internetretailer.com/commentary/2012/10/22/price-wars-dont-necessarily-maximize-profits-amazon-or-ebay" target="_blank">avoid price wars</a> to ensure you are still profitable.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #008080">23. Sell on other Marketplaces</span></h4>
<p>Post your products on marketplaces such as eBay and Amazon. You can leverage their credibility to build yours while making sales. However, be aware of the listing fees marketplaces charge. Easily export products from your PrestaShop store by purchasing any of the corresponding modules from the <a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/74-marketplace-prestashop-modules" target="_blank">Official Marketplace.</a></p>
<h4><span style="color: #008080">24. Run online Ad Campaigns</span></h4>
<p>Run online ad campaigns to drive customers to your online store. Be sure your ads are relevant to your product to ensure you are using your marketing dollars wisely. Learn how to run effective <a href="http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.com/en/us/adwords/pdf/step_by_step.pdf" target="_blank">Google Ad campaigns</a> by reading their step-by-step guide.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #008080">25. Throw a Party!</span></h4>
<p>You’ve just launched an online store! That in itself is a milestone and a huge success. Celebrate by throwing a party. It’s a great time to generate content for your social media, create buzz for the press, and meet people from your industry. Most importantly, it’s a great time to thank the people who&#8217;ve helped you get this far.</p>

We’re covering the 3 major spring holidays that are celebrated throughout the world to help you increase sales, traffic and customer satisfaction. We’ll give you tips for e-mails, social media and promotions so that you can capitalize on: Easter, Mother’s Day and Father’s Day!</p>
<h4><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Hop up Sales for Easter</span></h4>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter " target="_blank">Easter</a> is the first holiday in spring and families from around the world are celebrating. It’s the perfect opportunity to get creative with your marketing activities and take advantage of the wholesome cheer.</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">Promotions</span></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">From toys to chocolate to flowers to cameras – online merchants can run Easter promotions for all of their products. Try to get creative with your promotions to reflect the holiday spirit by using clever terms such as “Free ‘Eggspress’ Shipping” or “Eggcited for Easter Sale.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">See how this Montreal based PrestaShop store, <a href="http://www.sweetisabelle.com/en/ " target="_blank">Sweet Isabelle</a>, uses attractive, large images to promote their Easter cookie collection on their homepage.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-16483" title="Sweet Isabelle Easter" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/04/Sweet-Isabelle-Easter.jpg" alt="" width="379" height="273" /></p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">Social Media</span></h4>

<h4 style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">Email Marketing</span></h4>

A good place to browse for inspiration is Pinterest – take a look at these <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=easter%20email%20marketing " target="_blank">Easter Email Marketing</a> results.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Mother’s Day &amp; Father’s Day</span></h4>
<p>Both Mother’s Day and Father’s Day are two of the most important e-commerce sales holidays every year. Make sure to prepare in advance and start your sales and marketing strategies early!</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">Promotions</span></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Both of these holidays are perfect opportunities to add a featured product page on your online shop. Create pages with products customized for moms and dads such as: “50 Mother’s Day Gifts under $50” or “Perfect Father’s Day Gifts.” The easier your customers can find the perfect gift, the more likely they are to make a purchase. These types of pages will also greatly improve your SEO efforts and help you rank higher on search engine results.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="http://www.odealarose.com/" target="_blank">Ode a la Rose</a> is a great example of a PrestaShop store that used homepage banners to drive traffic to their Mother’s Day product pages last year.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-16480" title="Ode a la rose Mothers Day" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/04/Ode-a-la-rose-Mothers-Day.jpg" alt="" width="355" height="284" /></p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">Social Media</span></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Run a social media campaign that would make mom and dad proud! Start promoting these two holidays early to increase awareness and be the first to remind your customers that it’s just around the corner. Mother’s Day and Father’s Day tends to be a sentimental holiday so it’s a great time to run a social media contest. Ask your fans and followers to post photos with a caption about “Why their mom/dad is the best!” Having customers share this type of content will help you build a closer relationship.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now a days, every brick and mortar store is joining the world of e-commerce and PrestaShop has helped many merchants do so. In fact, no matter what you go in New Zealand, you’ll hear all about local mom and pop shops starting to sell online.</p>
<p>For others, they saw the value of selling online a long time ago – like <a href="http://lindenleaves.com.au/" target="_blank">Linden Leaves</a> who recently migrated their shop to PrestaShop.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16464" title="EN_Linden Leaves" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/04/EN_Linden-Leaves.jpg" alt="" width="585" height="372" /></p>
<p><span id="more-16463"></span></p>
<p>Linden Leaves is a well-known and established brand in New Zealand, exporting their products all over Oceania and Asia. New Zealanders love their hand made products and respect for the environment. This is why their brick and mortar store is always crowded and the main reason they needed a strong e-commerce solution to support their needs.</p>

However, too many merchants are missing out on sales and traffic as a result of poor quality product descriptions or even worse &#8230; <a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/sell-more-online-8-tips-for-your-product-descriptions/" rel="nofollow" class="more-link">Read more<span class="meta-nav"></span></a>]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For most online merchants, product descriptions may seem like a no brainer, an obvious necessity to selling online. However, too many merchants are missing out on sales and traffic as a result of poor quality product descriptions or even worse – copying the manufacturer’s generic content.</p>
<p>The good news, well-written product descriptions can give you the competitive advantage, helping you rank higher on search engines and increasing your bottom line. Draw in customers and sell more online with these must-read 8 tips for your product descriptions.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16405" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/04/EN_8-Tips-for-Product-Descriptions.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="230" /></p>
<h4><span id="more-16401"></span></h4>
<h4><span style="color: #f4a460">1) Wear your Customer’s Shoes</span></h4>
<p>Figuratively speaking, that is. No matter what you’re selling online, you should have a very good understanding of your target customer. Reflect that in your voice, language, and style. I strongly recommend creating an online persona, an imaginary customer, who absolutely loves to buy your products.</p>
<p>This Forbes article <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/groupthink/2013/07/03/online-personas-the-key-to-converting-customers/" target="_blank">“Online Personas: The Key to Converting Customers”</a> will help you fully understand your target audience. As a result, you’ll write unique product descriptions that effectively converts visitors into paying customers.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #f4a460">2) Persuade with Benefits</span></h4>
<p>Now that you are familiar with your online personas, you know which benefits will sway your customers to make a purchase. Highlight benefits by addressing questions such as: How is your product better than the competitor? How can your product solve a problem for your customer?<br />
Check out how this PrestaShop store, <a href="http://www.gretelhome.com/areaware/913-diamond-box-in-black.html" target="_blank">Gretel Home</a>, presents the benefits of their Diamond Box to appeal to customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-16408" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/04/store-2.png" alt="" width="550" height="400" /></p>
<p>In just 3 sentences, Gretel Home was able to point out 6 different benefits: multiple functionality, safe, seamless, perfect gift, inexpensive, and small. They also used sensory words to touch the soft spots of their customers – hold that thought, we’ll talk more about sensory words in just a bit.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #f4a460">3) Tell Stories</span></h4>
<p>Tap into your customers’ imagination. Transport them to a place and time where they see themselves using your product. Start a story and let customers fill in the details wherever they can relate. For some inspiration, look at how this PrestaShop store, Planete Chocolat, tells a story that stars their Box of Easter Chocolates.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-16407" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/04/store-3.png" alt="" width="634" height="259" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.planetechocolat.com/en/easter-chocolates/867-a-box-of-easter-chocolates.html" target="_blank">Planete Chocolat</a> created a product description that puts the product in the customer’s life. By using just the right amount of details they planted the seed of a story. They then let customers fill in the details of a perfect Easter morning.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #f4a460">4) Stimulate Your Customer’s Senses</span></h4>
<p>Let your customers feel. Do this by using sensory words that appeal to any of our five senses. Easily appeal to auditory senses with onomatopoeias, words that imitate the sound it makes. Some examples? Clocks tick, cell phones buzz, jewelry jangles and steaks sizzle. Each item you read made a sound you can hear.</p>
<p>As you stimulate each sense, you bring another dimension of your product to life. Want to feel the Nourishing Body Milk on your skin? Read the product description from this PrestaShop ecommerce site, <a href="//tahitiansecrets.com/en/-beauty-care-/39-lait-nourrisant-10-200-ml-3458517511255.html" target="_blank">Tahitian Secrets</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-16409" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/04/store-4.png" alt="" width="548" height="317" /></p>
<p>Most people know what velvety, silky, and smooth textures feel like. These descriptions allow customers to literally feel the product through their screen.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #f4a460">5) Details, Details, Details.</span></h4>
<p>What are the FAQ’s for your product? Product descriptions should answer all the basic questions a customers would ask. Start by answering a relevant question from each of these 5 categories:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">• <strong>Who</strong> – Who needs it? Who is it made for? Who made it?<br />
• <strong>What</strong> – What is the product? What features does it have? What is it for?<br />
• <strong>Where</strong> – Where is it made? Where should it be used?<br />
• <strong>Why</strong> – Why do customers need it? Why it is better? Why purchase it?<br />
• <strong>When</strong> – When was it made? When should they replace it?</p>
<p>Answer as many as possible while staying relevant. (By addressing commonly asked questions in product descriptions, you also save time on customer service.) See how this PrestaShop store, <a href="http://www.whatgoesaroundnyc.com/shop/luxury-shoulder-bags/21512-60CH-85668.html" target="_blank">WhatGoesAroundNYC</a> describes their Vintage Chanel Bag:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-16410" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/04/store-5-2.png" alt="" width="545" height="347" /></p>
<p>As a Vintage Luxury goods retailers, it is especially important to include the product’s condition. By listing the condition of each part, it shows that the product has been carefully inspected which increases trust – making a customer more likely to make the purchase.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #f4a460">6) Use Original, Keyword Rich Content</span></h4>
<p>SEO is all the rage! With most customers using search to find products, it is important to rank high in these search results. Increase your page rank by using keywords to improve your SEO. First step? Do away with generic manufacturer descriptions. With so many online merchants already using them, duplicating them on your site hurts your SEO.</p>
<p>Instead, view manufacturer descriptions as inspiration for your original content. But before you start writing, find relevant keywords for your product. <a href="http://adwords.google.com/keywordplanner" target="_blank">Google Adwords</a>’s Keyword Planner is a great way to start. You can also check out alternatives suggested by <a href="http://socialmediatoday.com/pamdyer/2039406/10-great-alternatives-google-keyword-research-tool" target="_blank">Social Media Today</a> such as Keyword Eye. Here’s their suggested top 10 keywords for “sunglasses”:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16437" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/04/store-61.png" alt="" width="526" height="398" /></p>
<p>As you write descriptions, pick a few relevant keywords to include. Each original, keyword rich product description you write will help to increase your SEO.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #f4a460">7) Be Easy on the Eyes</span></h4>
<p>It’s easy to get carried away with writing product descriptions. There are so many details you can include. Make sure your product descriptions are displayed in a format that is easy to read. Break up large paragraphs with bullet points. This allows customers to quickly scan through and find what they need. If you have lots to say, create both a short and long description. Check out how this PrestaShop bike store, <a href="http://www.btwin.com/en/leisure-mtb/17410-btwin-rockrider-340-c4-mtb.html" target="_blank">BTWIN </a>extensively details a product in a reader-friendly format.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-16404" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/04/store-7a.png" alt="" width="607" height="282" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-16402" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/04/STORE-7b.png" alt="" width="560" height="496" /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #f4a460">8) Let Customers Review</span></h4>
<p>Want free and original descriptions for your products? Look no further than product reviews. Content written by other shoppers seem more trustworthy because lying does not benefit them. Customer reviews can also provide information from a user’s perspective, addressing questions online merchants often forget.<br />
See how these customer reviews help <a href="http://www.justfab.fr/index.cfm?action=shop.viewproduct&amp;tab=shoe&amp;ha=8636E4A896FA6B8F92D455DCDDDFFB1E&amp;pid=638086" target="_blank">JustFab FR</a>, another PrestaShop merchant, with describing their product.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-16403" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/04/store-8.png" alt="" width="510" height="422" /></p>
<p>By addressing concerns about height and comfort, the customer reviews add helpful information for customers. Their praise for the product also helps to convert shoppers. The unique content in customer reviews helps with SEO!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No matter how big (or small) your online store, you’re always looking to convert visitors. Your conversion rate is essentially the life line of your online business. Ecommerce conversions cover a wide range of activities from purchasing products to subscribing to newsletters. Each of these actions show that visitors are not just interested but want to engage with you.</p>
<p>Since your success as an ecommerce merchant depends on conversion, I’m helping you by sharing the <strong>5 secrets for better ecommerce conversions.</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16304" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/03/EN_5-Secrets-for-better-ecommerce-conversions.jpg" alt="" width="590" height="341" /></p>
<p><span id="more-16288"></span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #339966">1. Mobile Friendly</span></h4>
<p>Google and Nielsen conducted a study last year to learn more about<a href="http://ssl.gstatic.com/think/docs/mobile-path-to-purchase-5-key-findings_research-studies.pdf" target="_blank"> shoppers and their use of mobile</a>. They found that 93% of people who used mobile to research a product go on to make a purchase. Yes, 93%! To convert these mobile shoppers, your store has to be easily accessible on mobile devices. Every mobile friendly site should:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">•  Have big buttons for easy use<br />
•  Fit into a smartphone-sized screen<br />
•  Load quickly with mobile internet speeds</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-16308" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/03/IMG-mobile-complete-edit.png" alt="" width="442" height="332" /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #339966">2. Stunning Images</span></h4>
<p>They say a picture is worth a thousand words. Make sure yours say, “Shop!” We understand that not all online merchants are photographers by trade. So we’ve come up with simple ways to improve product images:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">•  Use the <strong>right image quality</strong> – they should not be pixelated nor take too long to load<br />
•  Allow customers to<strong> zoom in</strong> to get a better view or to examine a particular detail.<br />
•  Have <strong>consistent backgrounds</strong> &#8211; Looking for a budget-friendly way? Remove the background.<br />
•  Learn even more in our article on how to <a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/improve-product-photos-online-store-the-5-mistakes-you-dont-want-commit/" target="_blank"><strong>Improve Product Photos for your Online Store.</strong></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-16314" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/03/IMG-bkg-color-1.png" alt="" width="534" height="201" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center">_____________________________</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-16315" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/03/IMG-bkg-color-2.png" alt="" width="534" height="192" /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #339966">3. Powerful Searchability</span></h4>
<p>Help customers find exactly what they want … or another site will. Having a <strong>search bar</strong> is a great start but is only helpful if customers know exact names of your product. PrestaShop makes it easy for customers to find what they’re looking for with both front and back office tools.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">•  In the front office, you can allow customers to<strong> filter by product attributes</strong> such as color, price, or size to help narrow down your product catalog.<br />
•  From the back office, you can <strong>refine common search terms</strong> by directing them to words you use. For example, when a customer searches “XS” you can direct them to the results page for “extra small”.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16307" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/03/IMG-filter-b.png" alt="" width="286" height="357" /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #339966">4. Effortless Shopping</span></h4>
<p>Make shopping on your site effortless by offering helpful tools throughout your site for a better shopping experience.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">•  Allow <strong>side by side product comparisons</strong> &#8211; Beyond that, PrestaShop creates unique links for product comparison so that your customers can share it with friends to get their input or bookmark it to view it later.<br />
•  <strong>Offering complementary products</strong>, commonly known as cross selling. If you’re selling wine, ask if they want glasses for that type of wine. Or if a customer adds an MP3 player to their cart, suggest that they add the matching case or headphones to their order. People forget things all the time, this is a nice way to help them complete their purchases and increase your average cart value!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-16309" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/03/IMG-product-comparison.png" alt="" width="596" height="391" /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #339966">5. Incentivize</span></h4>
<p>Everyone likes to feel like they’re getting a good deal. Attract customers who are on the fence with enticing incentives by:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">•  <strong>Offering</strong>— The<a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/how-to-increase-ecommerce-cart-value/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=marketplace+fairness+act" target="_blank"> types of ecommerce incentives</a> you offer depends on the types of conversions you’re trying to achieve. Get customers to subscribe to your newsletter by offering free shipping with their first order. Convince visitors to share your site with friends by giving rewards for each additional person they recruit with the link. Finally, get customers to shop by offering them a discount for purchases.<br />
•  <strong>Promoting</strong> — After all, if no one knows about the promo, does it really exist? With all types of banners built into PrestaShop 1.6, there are numerous places to highlight your promotions. Try placing it on the banner at the top of the page, within the rich navigation, or even on the homepage slider.</p>
